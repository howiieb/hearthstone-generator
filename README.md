# Hearthstone generator
This is a Java project that generates random Hearthstone cards. This was made for a university project, but is kinda fun, so is being published here too.

# How to run
This now has a web app! Check out http://howiieb.com/hearthstone-generator/.

Alternatively, if you want to run these files locally, run CardBuilder.java (in whatever IDE you enjoy, I don't quite feel like building this). The command line interface will guide you through the rest. This project should have no prerequisites.

# How it works
The report written for the university project is available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DtcC83qUC942zmqDzuqnyNP3iK05cOTc_d87OjKi9PY/edit?usp=sharing).
