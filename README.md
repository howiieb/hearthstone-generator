# Hearthstone generator
This is a Java project that generates random Hearthstone cards. This was made for a university project, but is kinda fun, so is being published here too.

# How to run
Run CardBuilder.java. The command line interface will guide you through the rest. This project should have no prerequisites.
I may do a web interface for this at one point, but it'll be after I'm done with the university project.

# How it works
The report written for the university project is available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DtcC83qUC942zmqDzuqnyNP3iK05cOTc_d87OjKi9PY/edit?usp=sharing).
